****Why This Matters****

"My mother tests her blood sugar 8 times a day. She makes 50+ health decisions daily that could save or endanger her life. She does this alone because the technology that could help costs $6,000 per year.
AuroraFlow exists because she—and 27 million Americans like her—deserve better. They deserve AI-powered insights. They deserve voice-first accessibility. They deserve to manage their diabetes with dignity and confidence.
This isn't just a student project or a business opportunity. This is personal. This is my mother's life. This is millions of lives.
If I can build even a small part of the solution, I will."

— Caitlin Przywara, Founder

**AuroraFlow**

AI-Powered Diabetes Management for Everyone

Voice-first, accessible diabetes tracking and insights for the 27 million Americans who can't afford expensive glucose monitoring technology.

**About**

AuroraFlow is a voice-first, AI-powered diabetes management application designed to make glucose tracking and personalized health insights accessible to everyone—not just those who can afford expensive continuous glucose monitors (CGMs).
Built with health equity at its core, AuroraFlow serves the 27 million Americans with Type 2 diabetes who cannot access $2,500-6,000/year CGM technology.
Personal Mission: This app was created for my mother, a Type 1 diabetic, and millions like her who deserve better tools to manage their health. Every line of code honors her daily struggle and strength.

**The Problem**

The Diabetes Crisis: 
38.4 million Americans have diabetes (11.6% of population)
$412.9 billion annual cost to the US economy
1,057 Americans die daily from diabetes complications
Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, kidney failure, and lower-limb amputations

**The Technology Gap**

CGMs (Continuous Glucose Monitors) are the gold standard:
Real-time glucose monitoring 24/7
Predictive alerts for dangerous highs and lows
Average 1.0 point A1C reduction
Cost: $2,500-6,000 per year

**Who Gets Left Behind:**

87% of Type 2 diabetics (insurance won't cover CGMs)
Low-income families choosing between insulin and rent
Elderly people on fixed incomes
Visually impaired individuals who can't use complex apps
Non-English speakers without localized apps
Rural communities without access to diabetes specialists

**The Solution**

AuroraFlow provides AI-powered insights for $30 glucose meters—not $3,000 CGMs.
